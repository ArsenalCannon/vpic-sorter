Run the following command to compile the program:
source module.sh
make

There are three scripts: sorter.sh, energy_sorter.sh trajectory.sh

sorter.sh: sort particles with different key
* change filepath to the directory containing the tracked trajectories
* particle: ion or electron
* the rest of the script loops over all time frames
  -- The configuration information is explained in configuration.c
  -- -k changes the key:
    0: Ux
    1: Uy
    2: Uz
    3: dX
    4: dY
    5: dZ
    6: i
    7: q

energy_sorter.sh: sort particles with energy as the key
* change tstep to the last time step
* the rest is similar as sorter.sh
* -k argument must be 8, so it will sort the particles with energy as the key

trajectory.sh: get high energy particle trajectories
* -n 1000 indicates number of particles
* -r argument can be modified. 10 indicates 1/10 of the maximum energy, while
  100 indicates 1/100 of the maximum energy

Then go to ../python
module load python/2.7-anaconda-2.1.0
* go to the bottom of trajectory.py.
  -- plot_ptl_traj(file, species) display the trajectories interactively
  -- plot_ptl_traj_direct and plot_ptl_traj_fermi are for the submitted paper
